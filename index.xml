      <description>Introduction After working on the Family Friendly version of Balls and Bricks we couldn&amp;rsquo;t help ourselves from creating one more skin and probably the last one.
We have been experimenting with neon/glowing techniques (after all our studio is called Glow Town&amp;hellip;) and we couldn&amp;rsquo;t resists the temptation of creating a version of our first game using these effects!
The Game! The game is exactly like the first version but now instead of boring colors the game is full of effects that accomplish a futuristic/space/glowing feeling.</description>

      <description>Introduction When you start a new studio some times the toughest thing to do is to decide where to start from. We had to pick which engine to use (We went with Unity) and what to build with it first. This time around we had no doubts though!
